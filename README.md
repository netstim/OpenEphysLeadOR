# Open Ephys Lead-OR

Plugin for the Open Ephys GUI to interface between micro electrode recording devices (for example the NeuroOmega, via the [OpenEphysNeuroOmega plugin](https://github.com/netstim/OpenEphysNeuroOmega)) and the visualization component of Lead-OR via the [3DSlicer extension](https://github.com/netstim/SlicerNetstim).

## Installation

The plugin is currently not available in the GUI Plugin installer. The compiled dll for GUI v6 is available from the Releases page. It should be extracted under `C:\ProgramData\Open Ephys\plugins-api8`.

Alternativly, one can also compile from source. See Open Ephys GUI Documentation for instructions.

The plugin depends on the [OpenEphysIGTLink](https://github.com/netstim/OpenEphysIGTLink) library.
